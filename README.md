scans for local bluetooth devices with names matching the description of those used in gas pump credit card skimmers. This software is directly derived from  the research done by Nathan Seidle as documented in this article:https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/gas-pump-skimmers

Note: you will need to enable SPI in raspi-config for this project to work

I, M1dn1ghtN1nj4 (Noah Greene), am updating the code to be a little more functional.  Credit still goes to the original author, Nathan Seidle, and the author of the script this was based on, Tyler Winegarner.
